# Economic Privilege, Neighborhood Characteristics, and Political Ideology are Associated with Racial Disparity in COVID-19 Vaccination


## Abstract

Vaccine uptake is critical to mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (US), but structural inequities pose a serious threat to progress on this front. Although both availability of vaccines and vaccination rates have been accelerating in recent weeks, is there disparity in who is accessing the vaccine based on race? We combine data from state and federal agencies to estimate the relationship between various social determinants of health and racial disparity in COVID-19 vaccinations at the county-level. After controlling for vaccine hesitancy, our findings indicate that economic privilege (education and income), neighborhood characteristics (information technology in the home and vehicle rate), and political ideology are significantly associated with racial disparities in COVID 19 vaccination.We further contrast how these factors relate to the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to the influenza vaccine, and  find that while there are several common factors related to both, there are key differences reflecting the unique societal context in which the pandemic has unfolded.
